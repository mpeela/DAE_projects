        <p>Cats are supper sweet but can be a pain sometimes. Some of them are know to be really energitic and others are know to be really independent but when they are quit they won't and don't pay so much attention to you but when they are energitic they could destroy eveything that you have and they are know to be boy cats who are the most energitic. Cats are also not that bad they will there with you when ever you need their love and will always love you even thought their actions does not show that. Key fact when a cat is close to it's death it will try it's best to spend as much time as it can with you.  </p>
