            <li>Dogs are such amazing animals they are such sweet and adorable and they are the best companions.</li>
           <li>They will always be there with you by your side and love you no matter what happens</li>
           <li>Their sense of smell is 10,000 to 100,000 times stronger than ours, and they can even dream during sleep, with their unique nose prints acting like fingerprints.</li>
           <li>Some breeds, like the Basenji, don't bark but make other sounds, while others, like Greyhounds, can run at speeds of up to 45 miles per hour.</li>
           <li> Dogs have three eyelids and a moist nose that helps them detect scents better.</li>
           <li>They can also sense human emotions, reacting to our moods.</li>
